I have created maps depicting the crime rates in Phoenix, AZ for the year 2020. To compile this data, I gathered crime data from the city of Phoenix's open data portal. Due to privacy concerns, a significant portion of the crime data lacks the full address of the crime scenes. Thus, I had to clean the data and use only the records with complete crime scene addresses for geocoding. I employed the Bing API to geocode these addresses.

The first map illustrates the occurrences of crimes within the city boundaries of Phoenix, with each occurrence represented by a transparent plot. The second map provides a visual representation of crime distribution within the various zip code boundaries in Phoenix. In this map, crime occurrences are depicted with transparent plots, and the locations of police stations are marked with blue dots. The third map presents crime rates within Phoenix's zip code boundaries, with varying crime rates depicted using a colormap. Areas with higher crime rates are indicated by dark red shading, while areas with lower crime rates are shown in light red.
